Data management plan for the research project Large-Scale Net-Shape Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) Component Manufacturing for Harsh Environments via Oxide Doping in Laser Directed Energy Deposition (LDED)

Context of the project:

This project is related to material science, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering. Our team are entirely working on material science part, specifically, computational work. Due to excellent mechanical properties, ODS alloys are widely used in harsh environments, like nuclear reaction container. However, conventional ODS manufacturing steps are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to develop a hybrid LDED oxide-doping additive manufacturing approach that makes net-shape component in a single step. This new technique is expected to reduce fabrication cost by 50% and energy consumption by 30%. The goal for our simulation is to develop an integrated model that can predict the particle size distribution in the as-built ODS sample with process parameters (laser power, scan speed, etc.) used in the experiment, which can further reduce the experimental cost. The experiment team will give us the particle size distribution in their samples to verify and correct our model in the beginning stage. Later our model should be able to predict the results without conducting experiment
